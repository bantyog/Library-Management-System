# Library-Management-System

## Overview

This project is a terminal-based application that **exemplifies** [illustrates by example] the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It was developed as part of a Software Engineering (SEN) assignment at Caleb University.

## SDLC Methodology

The development followed a strict Waterfall model:

1. **Planning:** Defined requirements for tracking `Book` and `Member` data.
2. **Design:** Established a **robust** [sturdy/strong] architecture using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
3. **Implementation:** Translated design into Python code.
4. **Testing:** Verified book issuance logic.
5. **Maintenance:** Version controlled via GitHub.

## Nomenclatures

To maintain **congruity** [agreement or harmony] between design and implementation, the following names were used:

* `Book`: Entity representing library assets.
* `Member`: Entity representing registered users.
* `Library`: The controller class managing logic.
* `issue_book`: The primary method for transaction processing.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed, then clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>

```

## Usage

Run the script directly:

```bash
python lms_system.py

```
